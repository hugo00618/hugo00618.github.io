				<h1>A Basic 3D Model Rendering with Three.js</h1>
				<p>
					This is a simple 3D rendering inspired by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit website</a>. It uses three.js, a JavaScript library based on WebGL that's easy to set up and provides various functionalities for 3D graphics.

				<h2>Modeling</h2>
				<p>
					Modeling was done through C4D. The main idea was to have a sphere and select all the faces that map to land and extrude them out. I downloaded a world map and used it as a texture for a regular sphere so that I had a good reference I could work on. This is the most tedious part of the whole project, espeically when dealing with those small islands in Southeast Asia. But later I found that it didn't need to be really precise as I was going to low-poly it anyway...

				<div class="image_wrapper">
					<img class="img_screenshot" src="assets/earth_1.png"/>
					<p class="annotation">Texture for reference</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					Since my reference image was a satellite map where it shows parts of the land close to the poles are covered by snow, I was able to map them seperately and extrude them a little bit more so it creates a feeling of snow covering the ground. Finally, just throw everything into a Polygon Reduction object and C4D will do the low poly trick for you.
